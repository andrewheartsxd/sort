This is my attempt to visually represent the merge sort algorithm. I got the algorithm from the following site:
http://www.stoimen.com/blog/2010/07/02/friday-algorithms-javascript-merge-sort/

I then added jQuery functions to add each sort step as a new DOM element, resulting in a visual representation of the sort process. I have not yet been able to get steps occurring at the same time onto the same line.
